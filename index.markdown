The **Lambda-4S** rocket is currently the smallest (by volume) rocket ever built by humans that has carried a Payload into Earth orbit. Much of it's history is fascinating.

## Digitized Data

Several old technical reports on the development and flight of the Lambda-4S are available. If possible the data from the papers have been digitized.

**[List of digitized datasets](data)**



## Flight Simulation

Using those technical reports and the digitized data a reconstruction of the flight has been built in the [JSBSim][jsbsim] simulation framework.
